The 4th RISC-V Summit China (RVSC2024) is scheduled for August 19 to 25, with the main conference and exhibition taking place at the Huanglong Hotel in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, from August 21 to 23. After several years of development, the RISC-V Summit China has become one of the world's three major RISC-V professional exhibitions and the largest RISC-V annual event in China. This year, it is expected to attract more than 3,000 domestic and foreign attendees to participate in-person and more than 500k viewers to watch online. At the same time, it is expected that more than 100 companies, research institutions, and open source technology communities will participate. The summit is being held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang for the first time since its establishment in 2021. RISC-V ecosystem partners and companies around the world are welcome to attend.

The RISC-V International is the leader of the global RISC-V Summits. The 2024 RISC-V Summit China Organizing Committee (OC) is responsible for the preparation and coordination of the Summit China. The Program Committee is responsible for the review of speech applications. This year's summit plans to set up more sub-venues and sub-forums to provide more speaking opportunities and longer speaking time to meet the communication and sharing needs of the speakers. All partners engaged in RISC-V related R&D and industry are welcome to contribute.
